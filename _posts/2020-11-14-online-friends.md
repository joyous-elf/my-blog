Chatting with strangers online was a big part of my experience on the internet and by doing this constantly I managed to make some friends along the way.
Making friends was one of the most important reasons I've been chatting ever since I was 13 years old.
 The term 'friends' is overated on social media, but I'm gonna tell you about real friends, that are not just in my 'friend list', but in my heart.
Maybe the interactions are virtual, but the feelings are real.
I dedicate this blog post to all my online friends out there, wherever they are.

## My first online friend

After I've had some disappointments regarding some online interactions, when I was 15 years old, I met a guy on the social network called hi5.
He was very nice to me, without having hidden intentions.
He didn't talk much, he was a good listener and I was very happy, especially because at that time I had no friends in real life.

I remember that I asked for a gift for my 16th birthday and he really made a birthday card for me, which you can see below.
I was so happy he cared enough to do it.
I also learned some things about the Arab culture from him, as he was an Arab.
That information made me want to know more, so I read two books on the matter.

At some point, when I decided to delete all my accounts, we lost connection for some years, until I was in university and decided to connect with him again though Facebook.
That was also a very happy moment for me.

We kept in touch until recently, when some time after he got married, he deleted me from friends.
While it's true we haven't talked very much lately, it still hurt that I discovered he deleted me when I tried to contact him.
But anyway, I will always cherish the memories of my first online friend.

## Some more friends

After I met my boyfriend on *sharedlingo*, a language exchange site, I started making new friends.
At first, there was this guy also from sharedlingo, whom I met before my boyfriend.
He was difficult to understand at first, but I liked him so we kept in touch.
His English is better than mine, because he's a translator.
He has always been helpful with explaining words or phrases I couldn't understand and I have been grateful for it.
Also, he has always given some good real life pieces of advice too.
And to be honest, how can I not like a person who expresses in English so well.

Then, when my grandma died, I was feeling devastated and I heard from my boyfriend that there is a website called [7cups](https://www.7cups.com/), where you can talk to nice strangers if you have some problem and you need someone to listen to you, so I made an account but for some reason I encountered some error and couldn't connect with anyone.
So, I started looking for similar sites and I found [blahtherapy](https://blahtherapy.com/).
At first, it didn't seem like a good choice because people weren't understanding and considerate, until I met my future friend.

He's been a very good friend, he has always encouraged me.
I've learned a lot from him about the society he lives in, about optimism and open-mindedness.
I feel that he never judges me, so I can tell him anything.
In fact, I usually prefer to talk to my online friends than to people I know in real life because I feel less judgment from them.
As unusual as it may seem to some people, I feel closer to my online friends than to my offline ones, because I can talk easier to them.

After that, I met some guy on *hellolingo*, a successor to *sharedlingo*, which also doesn't exist anymore.
He was a nice, open minded guy and I liked that he also had an online relationship, which is offline now.
I liked listening to part of his life story, mostly because he gave me hope regarding my own relationship and I also admired him for all he has done until now.
I don't keep in touch with him as much as with the people mentioned previously, but I still enjoy talking to him.

## Waiting for new friends

Most recently I met a good guy in a virtual reality mobile game called Avakin.
He doesn't play anymore, but we kept in touch, and as far as I can tell, he is a possible future friend and I'm happy about it, because I've been playing that game for months and he's the only person I could find out there who just wants to keep in touch, without other intentions.
Finding a new friend gives a great joy, because most people online are primarily interested in casual sexual interactions, or at least that's what I've seen so far.
That's the reason why I cherish my online friends even more and I'm always waiting for new ones, just like Wumpus, the Discord mascot.
To share a connection for a long time with somebody you never met in real life feels awesome and I think everyone should try it.
