Have you ever liked doing something so much that you felt you can't live without it?
Practicing English is not just a hobby for me, it's a passion because I just can't do without it on a daily basis.
I wanna tell you how my relationship with the language developed during the years.

## Primary and middle school nightmare

My first encounter with English happened in the first grade when I was 7.
I remember I used to hate English because we had a bad teacher, the worst I have ever had.
We were all scared of her, it was a nightmare and it lasted for 8 whole years.

During this time, I needed a tutor because my teacher, besides scaring us, didn't explain grammar well.
I think I was 10 or so when mom decided I needed help with English and she wanted my teacher from school to be my tutor.
It scared me but I didn't tell mom this, I don't know why.
Luckily, she had too many students so she recommended us another teacher who turned out to be amazing.
Since then, I began to change my opinion about English, because of my tutor.

## High school specialization choice

When I had to choose a specialization for high school, I didn't consider an English specialization as my first option, but a social sciences one instead.
During that time I met some American guy online and I was so happy I could chat with him that I wanted to find out more about the language, so I chose the English specialization after all.
It turned out to be a good decision because I got into a top notch class.
Luckily, in high school I had a good teacher.
The first years were still difficult with all the grammar and vocabulary homework, but now I can say that the effort was worth it.

I think the main reason why I love English in the first place is because it reminds me of high school and all the good times I had there.
That's part of the reason why I sought to maintain my level of English, because if I forgot the language, I'd feel like loosing a part of my most precious memories related to my teen years.
This feeling is quite difficult to explain.

## Practicing the language

After high school I kept trying to chat in English to practice it.
We've had English classes in university except for one semester, the other teachers didn't satisfy my needs and this is normal because students had very different levels of English.
So I was texting to strangers until I realized I also had to practice speaking and that's how I met my boyfriend.
And I've been chatting and also speaking in English with him ever since, and it has been more than 4 years since we met.
I feel so lucky I get to practice English every day with the one that I love.
I think this made me love the language even more.
