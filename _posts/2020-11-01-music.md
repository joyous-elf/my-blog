Listening to music has been part of my every day life ever since I was 12.
I remember I used to watch music channels a lot when I was a teen.
I mostly listen to pop, rock, country and folk music.
My favorite decade is the 2000's.
When I was younger I knew all the popular songs but since I got into university I've been more selective with the music I listened to.

Music has always been there for me, through good and bad times.
I wanted to share with you some of my favorite artists that I think are not very well known.

[Ermal Meta](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJbWj2ntPh3vQ4OIARcFF8Q) is an Italian singer of Albanian origin.
I discovered him in 2017 when he came second in the Sanremo Festival, in which the winner goes to Eurovision.
I really liked Italy's Eurovision song that year and this is how I got to listen to Ermal too.
Here is one of my favorite song from him: [Ragazza Paradiso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpxx-cNCmdU), but I invite you to listen to all his songs if you like Italian.

[Dermot Kennedy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTujaKfo0jMXXhjvRtB6yYQ) is an awesome Irish singer who hits you right in the feels.
I know he have few popular songs like "Power over me" or "Outnumbered", but he has many others and I think he deserves much more recognition because he's something else.
My favorite song from him is [Lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK9wqtAwnoE).

[Kane Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2QTDn02Xobvy_N2bb_Zzlw) is a modern country singer which I absolutely love.
Although I love modern country in general, I don't follow country artists but Kane is an exception.
As I'm writing this in November 2020, I know that lately he had a song on the radio called "Be like that", which is ok-ish but he has other songs which are much better and which deserve to be discovered.
Some of my favorites are [Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRX0wDNK6S4) and [Worship you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_STxS_yy0c).

[Antract](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr-ZXy8YoxKbHHIotpTFPQA) is a Romanian rock band, which although is an old band, I've just recently discovered.
I just love their songs.
One of my favorites is [DezbracÄƒ-te de tine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39yuqEi3zd0).
