People should be more aware of how to be more secure and at the same time protect their personal data online. Privacy and security are fundamental human rights and we must fight for them. Many well known apps invade our privacy, just see the new [WhatsApp privacy policy controversy.](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/whatsapp-gives-users-ultimatum-share-data-with-facebook-or-lose-access-4117377) If you are looking for alternatives to the apps that invade your privacy, in this post I will recommend a course which will teach you about those and much more about privacy and security.

## The importance of privacy and security

Our online personal data can be used for:
- market manipulation, when our data leaks at some companies that keep calling/emailing us for advertising themselves
- identity theft
- personal stalking
- mass surveillance, one of the most problematic

So it's important to protect your privacy and implement better security (Go Incognito 1.2).

## Security vs. Privacy

- security - how you protect your phone, hard drive and data (passwords, encryption, anti-virus)
- privacy - any info related to your personal identity
- for example an anti-virus offers you security of your data but no privacy because all your scanned documents are sent to the anti-virus company and they could sell it to third parties (Go Incognito 1.3).

## Go Incognito
To get an insight into privacy and security and also improve it, I recommend you [Go Incognito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGR8_BcXIgw&list=PL3KeV6Ui_4CayDGHw64OFXEPHgXLkrtJO) by [Techlore](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs6KfncB4OV6Vug4o_bzijg) because:
- it's free to watch
- every video is short (3-11 min) so you can watch whenever you have time without feeling burdened by long videos
- quite easy to understand (Motto: ''Privacy and security to the masses'')
- the basics are easy to implement (sections 1-3)
- goes beyond online privacy and security showing that offline privacy and security are also important (section 6)
- the channel has a [website](https://techlore.tech/) with a lot of resources
- has a [privacy and security checkup quiz](https://techlore.tech/spa.html) which you can take even right now

## Advocate for privacy and normalize it

This course convinced me to advocate for privacy and security, meaning I wanna share what I've learned about them, starting with this course and I invite you to do the same. Hoping that it sparked your interest, please share it with your friends. If more and more people learn about privacy and security we will have a more private and secure world.

And the last thing I wanna tell you is to normalize privacy. People usually associate online privacy with criminal activity, which should change  because "you may have nothing to hide, but everything to protect" as Mikko Hypponen, a security expert said. Privacy is a fundamental human right and it's related to our freedom.
