## Approaching anxiety

Most of my life I've been suffering from constant anxiety, so I decided to do something about it because it's just too much sometimes. I'm writing this post hoping to give people ideas about what they can do if they are constantly anxious. It will be published in two parts and in this one I will focus on the more formal approaches to anxiety that I've learned from specialists. In this regard, I took several free online courses and I will present you some aspects from one of those courses in particular which was the best for me in training resilience skills.

## Resilience training

[Positive Psychology: Resilience Skills](https://www.coursera.org/learn/positive-psychology-resilience/home/welcome) is a very practical course for reducing anxiety and thus increasing resilience skills. Just as the name suggests, it is based on Positive Psychology which is a new branch in psychology aiming to help people increase their well being, optimism and resilience. While the course is free and anyone can access it, I want to present to you the exercises that have actually helped me deal with my anxiety and ill being and that I still practice on a regular basis.

### Real time resilience exercise

This type of exercise is useful if you are or are about to be in a situation in which you get anxious and counterproductive thoughts come to mind. There are 3 helpful ways to combat counterproductive thinking:
1. _Evidence_
- use vivid data to prove to yourself why what you are thinking is not true: **That is not true because...**
2. _Reframe_
- reframe the way you perceive the situation: **A better way to see this is...**
3. _Plan_
- make a contingency plan: **If x happens then I will y.**

*Example of the exercise*
   - Situation: I​ will go visit my boyfriend who lives in an other country for the first time soon.
   - C​ounterproductive thought: I'm afraid I'll not be able to adjust to the situation and as a result we will eventually break up.
   - R​eframe: **A better way to see this is** as an opportunity to have a new experience. It will be my first time away from home. :)
   - E​vidence: **That is not true because** my boyfriend loves me and we have always communicated very well ever since we met. We have  created a very strong bond over time.
   - P​lan: **If** we encounter any issues **then** we will discuss them and try to find a solution. **If** we break up, **then** I will move on with my life because I have to.

I want to point out that this exercise helped me a bit just when I anticipated a situation in which I could have a high level of anxiety but not in an actual anxious state. Maybe if practiced enough it can help anytime.

### Practicing deliberate breathing

**Breathing exercises** help me relax and reduce my anxiety. I do such exercises every morning for 10 minutes with the help of an alarm to remind me and an app called [Breathly](https://breathly.app/) to guide me. What is cool about this app, besides being free and open source, is the fact that you can set your custom breathing exercise according to your needs. I personally breath in for 5 seconds and then breath out for other 5 seconds, as the course suggests.

### Practicing gratitude daily

**Gratitude** is a positive emotion which increases happiness and decreases depression. It leads to a more helping behavior and to stronger spirituality. It is not specifically for reducing anxiety but for improving well being in general and it has helped me. I personally practice it every night before sleep by thinking of 3 good things that happened to me during the day. This exercise is called **The 3 good things** or **Hunt for the good stuff**. You can also write those 3 things down. Setting an alarm is also important because you should do such an exercise daily until it becomes a good routine and you will do it without even realizing it.

## Try it yourself!

The Positive Psychology: Resilience Skills course has helped me manage my anxiety better especially by teaching me how to challenge counterproductive thoughts using real time resilience, by making me want to do breathing exercises daily or by cementing my daily gratitude practice. I really hope this post was helpful to you and I encourage you to try the exercises I have described. Furthermore, give a try to the whole course [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/positive-psychology-resilience/home/welcome) because it has much more to offer than what I have presented. Also, if you want to learn further how to increase your well being you can try all the courses from Foundations of Positive Psychology [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/positivepsychology?answerId=2KYy962tEeuAwA5JxuJq6Q#courses).
