I've been feeling very lonely lately. I've been physically isolated from others ever since the autumn of 2019. I also haven't seen my boyfriend in 2 years. I've had some online projects and while it feels good to do tasks and win money, it doesn't really help with isolation. I think working from home even increases the feeling of loneliness, as well as the anxiety about the job because you never meet people face to face to discuss about it.

The best part of my day was taking online courses but also chatting for some time now. But I have to say I'm so tired of chatting to strangers. While I know it is not the same as meeting face to face, I enjoy meeting new people online sometimes, but right now I'm so drained. I don't know what to do to feel better, but cut down on chatting to strangers and going out more. It's so frustrating to me that I haven't found a way yet to help people. I tried listening and giving advice but this seems to be even more harmful, so I'm not a good listener. I have no idea how else I could help people. I know I'll always have few people near me, who will always be there for me, but sometimes it's nice to meet and try to get to know new people. At what emotional cost? I know that I'll be just fine, I've been here before, but right now I'm not and I just wanted to put it on paper and maybe share with others.
