This is the second part of _Ways to manage anxiety better_ in which I wanna talk about the informal ways I'm dealing with this issue. When I say informal I mean what I have learned from experience and not through formal training, because experience is a great teacher. I hope that this will be useful to those of you suffering from anxiety.

## Talking about it to someone

I think that talking about your problems to someone is very important for your mental health. I try to do it as much as possible and I advise everyone to try doing it even if it may be difficult for different reasons. I can tell you from experience that it is worth it.

When I'm anxious I keep ruminating on the things I'm worried about and with time, I discovered that the most effective way for me to calm down is to talk about it or about anything else really. I talk to different categories of people: to friends and to strangers.

### Talking to friends

Having friends to talk to about anything is a blessing. When I'm anxious I firstly talk to my boyfriend about it but I always feel like I need more perspective on what I'm worrying about so I turn to my online friends who give me their point of view on the matter. You can do it with family members or the friends you have in real life of course.

My advice is to try talking to your optimistic friends when you are very anxious. Pessimistic people might make you even more anxious. They most probably have good intentions but if it makes you more worried it's not helpful at all, so better talk to the optimists.

### Chatting to strangers online

Chatting to strangers online can be helpful for me when I don't wanna exhaust my boyfriend and my friends. I do it on a website called [7cups](https://www.7cups.com/). There are volunteers there just to listen to you, but you must remember they aren't professionals. Because of this, it may take a long time to find a good listener, but if you are patient and understanding, you will surely find someone suitable for you.

I recommend this to people for whom opening up is more difficult. It can be easier to chat to a stranger who you won't talk to again because you won't worry that the person will use what you said against you later or that you are burdening him or her.

## Calming activities

I find listening to music calming when I'm anxious. I listen to acoustic rock, folk or instrumental music. The most helpful music for me when I was really anxious was [Yiruma's music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z5EjAmZS1o) or Ed Sheeran's calm songs. I also like taking hot baths because they calm me down.

## You can learn from experience too

When you have a quiet moment I suggest you ask yourself what has helped with your anxiety in the past so you will be more prepared to fight it in the future. Knowing what works for you is extremely important.
