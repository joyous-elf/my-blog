Everyone loves getting high and people get high on all sorts of stuff. I sometimes get high on certain people, but aren't we all sometimes? I just wanna explore this feeling a bit because I just feel like it today. I feel like today is a good day for writing down what has been going on with me for some time.

For me getting high on people means getting obsessed with them, which is unhealthy in the long run but it's not something I can help. Also it can feel like falling in love but it's not, love and friendship develop in time, a long time. Is it attraction? Yes, partly but I feel that is more like longing for a deeper connection with an other person. If the connection is established it feels amazing, but it also takes time.

When I was lonely in the past I used to get a bit obsessed with anyone who'd give me a bit of attention, only to get frustrated sometime after because they weren't like they seemed to be in the beginning. Most people always seem nice in the beginning and when you try to know them better you become disappointed with the image you made in your head about them. Not all highs end up in frustration and then oblivion though. Some of them transform in love or friendship, which is also a kind of love.

The good thing about being obsessed with someone is that I wanna talk to them, discover them more, so I insist on it, they like it and the good ones remain. Actually this is how I got to be together with my boyfriend. He told me it happened because I was insistent in the beginning and I am so happy about it. My high actually helped me develop the relationship further into a friendship and then into love. Other time my obsession helped me get a long time friend and I'm proud of it.

I haven't had this feeling for a long while until recently. I am very surprised this has happened to me again as I am not feeling as lonely as I used to feel, but I guess I can't help but look for new meaningful relationships. This whole experience has been such a roller coaster for me with highs and lows but now as I'm writing this I still feel high but happy about it, very happy actually. I'm glad I am still able to enjoy this feeling with new people but only time will tell how this will turn out to be.
