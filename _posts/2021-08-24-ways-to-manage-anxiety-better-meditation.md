## My journey to manage anxiety

I am a very anxious person which is why I am always trying to find new ways to manage my anxiety. Managing my anxiety would help me improve my well-being. I would like to share my experiences with you hoping that you will be inspired to take action to improve your own life. I have started telling you about my journey when I took a formal training for reducing anxiety about which I wrote in a [previous post](https://joyous-elf.github.io/my-blog/personal%20experiences/2021/05/10/ways-to-manage-anxiety-better-formal-training.html). Now I wish to continue what I have started there and tell you about another way which helps me with my anxiety: mindfulness meditation.

## Mindfulness meditation


I started asking myself about mindfulness because it was mentioned in all the well-being courses I have ever taken but none of them explained the concept clearly for me so I took a course called [De-Mystyfying Mindfulness](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindfulness). This course gave me both some theoretical framework for mindfulness meditation and a bit of help in its practice on a daily basis. Right now for me mindfulness means to pay attention to the things I do automatically like breathing. And this helps me relax sometimes, especially when I feel bad. I try to practice it every day regardless of how I feel because it is important to keep it as a habit.

## Types of meditations I practice

The type of meditation I practice is called guided meditation, meaning that someone on a recording guides you through the process, which can help a lot. Here are the types of meditations I keep on practicing to this day:

### Breath and body 

This is my favorite as it focuses on the breath and the whole body and it is short. It can be done sitting or laying down and I love this because most of the other types should be done only while sitting, which is not very comfortable for me. Also it has proven to be much better than the deliberate breathing technique I was using before because the only guidance I had then was when to inhale and when to exhale, while in this type of meditation guidance is much more personal and you don't have to change the way you breathe so I love it. I try to do this one every single day, if I can find some time when I can be totally alone. You can try it too here: [Breath and body meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjQf5BSZXBc).

### Body scan

In this meditation you have to focus on each part of your body in turn, which can be very relaxing for me sometimes. I practice this type of meditation only when I feel like I need more than focusing on the breath. It also should be done laying down so I love it for this. You can try it here: [Body scan meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyKhfUdOEgs).

### Befriending/Love and kindness meditation

This type of meditation is very dear to me as it encourages you to wish yourself well: **May I be safe, happy and healthy. May I have ease of being.** After that, you should do the same for a loved one, then for a stranger and finally for a person whom you find difficult at the moment. I think this type of meditation is very important because it can make you realize we all deserve to be happy and in my opinion wishing people happiness even only in your mind can make you feel good.

## Recommendations

If you are interested in trying meditation I advise you to do it with some kind of theoretical framework which will help you understand the practice. I took a course called [De-Mystyfying Mindfulness](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindfulness) which was the best resource I could find for both the theoretical and the practical part for me, personally. The instructor problematizes different facets of mindfulness very nicely, and although his speech may be difficult to understand at times, I like that he doesn't give definite answers or definitions, he just presents different aspects of mindfulness and lets you think and choose for yourself. I have tried other course, but I highly recommend this one.

In the end I also want to to tell you not to be discouraged if you practice mindfulness and it seems like you don't do it right, I also feel the same. Some days I can focus on it more than others, but I'm happy as long as I do it daily. Of course, you may not find mindfulness meditation suitable for you, which is totally fine. **May you be safe, happy and healthy. May you have ease of being. And don't forget that happiness has to come from within yourself.**
