It's been a long time since I last posted here. That's because I've been taking free self development courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), where you can take all sorts of free courses. I focused on the personal development ones because they were the most appealing to me. Those courses helped me regain my love of learning. I will quickly tell you something about each of them.

#### [Finding purpose and meaning in life](https://www.coursera.org/learn/finding-purpose-and-meaning-in-life/home/welcome)
- short, enjoyable, inspirational course
- it gives you some ideas of how to identify your purposes in life
- Here is my purpose statement: ***"I wanna be family oriented, helpful to others around me, as independent as I can be, courageous, happy and fun loving"***,what's yours?

#### [The science of well-being](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being/home/welcome)
- what makes us happy according to science
- misconceptions about happiness
- you have a little assignment daily so you can practice what you've learned, this is what sets the course apart from others

#### [Success](https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-success/home/welcome)
- the basic idea of this course is that there is no universal recipe for success, you have to define it for yourself and make a plan to achieve it
- drafting a plan was frustrating for me

#### [Resilience skills in a time of uncertainty](https://www.coursera.org/learn/resilience-uncertainty/home/welcome)
- this is one of the most useful courses I've taken so far
- it gives you practical strategies to manage anxiety and build up resilience
- I recommend it to everybody struggling with anxiety

#### [Mind control: Managing your mental health during covid-19](https://www.coursera.org/learn/manage-health-covid-19/home/welcome)
- for anyone who wants a really easy, relaxing and short course
- awesome teacher

#### [Introduction to psychology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-psych/home/welcome)
