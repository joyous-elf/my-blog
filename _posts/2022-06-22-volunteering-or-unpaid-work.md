title: Volunteering or Unpaid Work?

I believe that in Romania volunteering is still largely regarded as unpaid work but to me there is a huge difference between the two. In this short post I want to point out why they are not the same.

## What volunteering means to me

Volunteering is offering a service because:

- you want to do it (it should never be forced on you)
- you have the time and resources for it
- you believe in the cause of the organization/person you are helping
- you want to gain experience, knowledge, mentorship, connections
- you ultimately want to help living beings in a way or another

## Unpaid work

Unpaid work has the following characteristics:

- it can feel like heavy work which you wouldn't do for free
- it may come disguised as volunteering but without a proper volunteering pitch 
- prospects may promise payment but they give no actual guarantee for it

## Why isn't volunteering socially valued?

In my everyday experience I have noticed that volunteering is not generally regarded as valuable to people. What I mean by this is that when I talk to people about what I do, right now I always mention my volunteering experience because it is very important to me. But when I tell them I am volunteering many suddenly become rather disengaged. Is it because it is associated with unpaid work? Is it considered not really work? I don't know the answers but I know it should be valued because the ultimate true meaning of volunteering is helping living beings.
