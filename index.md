# Welcome to my blog

I'm a girl from Romania and I started this blog by writing about different periods of my life just because I wanted to write down some of my memories. After a while I decided to also write about subjects unrelated to my personal life but something that everyone could find useful and for now I will tackle issues related to the digital world and hopefully I will come up with new subjects as the blog develops.
