# Digital privacy and security

I've known for a long time that online security is important but only recently I've found out how important privacy also is. It all started with my boyfriend always nagging me about it until I understood that protecting your privacy means protecting your freedom. He recommended me a course about it on Youtube and I learned a lot from it. Hopefully I can convince you how important privacy and security are and you will take interest in the course too. I know that people's time is limited but this course is really worth it because privacy and security are fundamental human rights.

## The importance of privacy and security

Our online personal data is used can be used for:
- market manipulation, when our data leaks at some companies that keep calling/emailing us for advertasing themselves
- identity theft
- personal stalking
- mass surveillance, one of the most problematic
So it's important to protect your privacy and implement better security. (Go Incognito 1.2)

## Security vs. privacy

Security - how you protect your phone, hard drive and data (passwords, encryption, antivirus)
Privacy - any info related to your personal identity
An illustrative example: An antivirus offers you security of your data but no privacy because all your scanned documents are sent to the antivirus company and they could sell it to third parties. (Go Incognito 1.3)

## Go Incognito
To get an insight into privacy and security and also improve it, I recommend you [Go Incognito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGR8_BcXIgw&list=PL3KeV6Ui_4CayDGHw64OFXEPHgXLkrtJO) by [Techlore](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs6KfncB4OV6Vug4o_bzijg) because:
- it's free to watch
- every video is short (3-11 min) so you can watch whenever you have time without feeling burdened by long videos
- quite easy to understand (Motto: ''Privacy and security to the masses'')
- the basics are easy to implement (sections 1-3)
- goes beyond online privacy and security showing that offline privacy and security are also important (section 6)
- the channel has a [website](https://techlore.tech/) with a lot of resources
- has a [privacy and security checkup quiz](https://techlore.tech/spa.html) which you can take even right now

## Advocate for privacy and normalize it

This course convinced to advocate for privacy and security, meaning I wanna share what I've learned about them, starting with this course and I invite you to do the same. Hoping that it sparked your interest, please share it with your friends. If more and more people learn about privacy and security we will have a more private and secure world.

And the last thing I wanna tell you is to normalize privacy. People usually associate online privacy with criminal activity, which should change  because "you may have nothing to hide, but everything to protect" as Mikko Hypponen, a security expert said. Privacy is a fundamental human right and it's related to our freedom.
