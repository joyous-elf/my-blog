# Useful apps for a long distance relationship

Are you or will you be separated by distance from your loved one? If the answer is yes, here are some apps which help me and my boyfriend feel a little bit closer to each other.

## Apps for chatting

In the past we used Skype and then WhatsApp, but lately we wanted our conversations to be more private because we have been thinking about our online privacy a lot, maybe I will make a post related to it later. So now we are using [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) mostly for texting. The app has an option for secret chats, for enhanced privacy. Find out how those chats work on their [official FAQ page](https://telegram.org/faq#secret-chats).

Other really cool Telegram feature is its huge collection of stickers, I've not seen something similar on any other chatting app I've tried.

We also use another chatting app called [Signal](https://signal.org/en/) mostly for calls. This app is also very good for privacy. On there official website they say: "Signal is designed to never collect or store any sensitive information. Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private, and secure." You can find more information about it [here](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007320391-Is-it-private-Can-I-trust-it-). If you are really concerned about your online privacy I recommend you try this app. It doesn't have a nice collection of stickers but it's a good app overall.

## Apps for remote control

I find apps used for remote technical support not only very practical and helpful but they also help us feel closer in my opinion. When we met we started using [Teamviewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/), which is free if you don't use it commercially and although we used it only for personal use, for some reason it flagged us and we couldn't use it anymore.

What we use now is called [AnyDesk](https://anydesk.com/en). It allows you to connect to other computers and to operate them with the main purpose of solving technical issues. But besides that, it is a good way to share screen if the images are not changing really fast, I mean it won't perform well if you wanna watch the other person playing a video game. However, you can use screen sharing for learning from one another different skills required on the PC.

## App for watching videos together

Last but not the least I wanna recommend [Sync Play](https://syncplay.pl/), a software which makes sure that media players like VLC (only VLC, read their docs) are synchronized when people far away from each other want to watch videos together. It works not only with the video files you have on your PC but also with popular video platforms like YouTube (or any other).

Now here's a list of all apps presented in this article:
- [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
- [Signal](https://signal.org/en/)
- [Teamviewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/)
- [AnyDesk](https://anydesk.com/en)
- [Sync Play](https://syncplay.pl/)

I really hope you will find something useful and I wish for you what I wish for myself: may your online relationship become offline one day for good.
