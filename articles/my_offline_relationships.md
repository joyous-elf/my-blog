#   My offline relationships

I wanna talk about the my relationships over the years and I will focus on different periods of my life and on different groups I have been part of.

## Family
My relationship with my immediate family has always been a good one. I was a wanted child, so my parents were happy to have me. They have always been supportive of me. Now, when I think about it I wish they were harsher on me as a child so I could be more independent, but I'm not going to blame my parents for my own failures. So, at home I was in a very protected environment, but things changed when I went to school.

## Classmates

In primary school the only thing I clearly remember is that it was physically difficult for me to write. But I didn't care much about my relationships with other classmates. People were nice to me but that was all. I was just trying my best to get good grades.

Things changed in middle school, as I began to care more about my relationships and how other people perceived me. I used to do things so other people liked me or at least didn't bother me, for example letting them *borrow* my homework. But I didn't have any friends, even if most people were nice to me and they would help me walk if we needed to go to other classrooms. At the end of middle school I was very disappointed in everyone and felt used by my classmates. However, everything got a little bit better in high school.

In high school I have lived one of the best periods of my life so far, especially the last two years of it. The 9th grade was extremely stressful for me and in 10th grade I was very busy, handling both constant physical exercises and homework. School work was difficult or this is how it seemed for me until the 11th grade when I realized I just stressed too much and I shouldn't have.

Then I started to focus on improving my relationship with my classmates because before that moment I was too stressed to care about it. I really liked most of my classmates from high school. With some of them I try to keep in touch to this day. However, I didn't find that really close friend I was looking for and things were about to get much worse in university.

In university I was a part of a group I didn't like at all, because I think that we didn't share same values or at least this is how it seemed to me, so that particular period of my life was a very lonely one. Studying was quite interesting but I was always feeling upset and lonely. So I was chatting online to try to forget what I was feeling and this way I met my boyfriend.

## Romantic relationships

I haven't had a romantic relationship until I was 22. Of course, I liked a couple of guys but nothing more than that, until I met my boyfriend and it has been the best relationship outside my immediate family I've ever had. Before meeting him, I used to think that I may never find somebody because I am disabled but I was wrong about it. He has helped me through so much that was happening in my life, including work.

## Work relationships

All jobs I had so far were remote so the quality of the relationships were poor. At first I worked for a Youtube channel and I was talking only to my boss to discuss problems or to update him on my progress. And after my boss quit, I was a transcriber for one of my university teachers and it went the same way. Not only I was feeling extremely tired, especially at my first job, but also extremely lonely. Working remotely, although beneficial for many reasons, can get depressing.
