# Social media and break ups

In this blog post I'm gonna tackle the problems associated with break ups in today's world dominated by technology and social media.
I don't have a personal experience related to this and in fact I have never broken up with somebody before but I'd still like to address this issue.

Break ups are difficult in general and take time to recover from.
Nowadays, social media puts an extra burden on people going through such a problem because they most likely still follow their former lover on social media and see what they wouldn't like to see.

Even if most of what people post on social media is just for show, it still affects people greatly, especially if they are upset and I tell this from experience too.
Because of our sadness we tend to forget that people post only things that are appealing to other people, so on social media we see only the good side of people's life.

In the past, not longer than 10-11 years ago, people could just go home, be alone and deal with whatever problems they had in their own way, but today thanks to smartphones and social media we are never alone because we are addicted to them and it can be maddening.
People who go through a break up are constantly shown what their exes *want* people to see they are doing, and in additon, they might see old pictures as *memories* with their former lovers.
Sure, you can unfollow that person, but he or she will still appear on common friends posts.

So, going through a break up may be more difficult today than it was in the past.
Then, when people weren't connected 24/7 through technology, you could just move away from your ex and never see him or her again, but today is not so easy when you follow all your acquaintances on social media platforms.

My advice for those who feel that their mental health is affected in any way by social media is just to not use it for a while or use it rarely, I've been doing that myself for some time and it has been beneficial.
Also, they should talk to their close friends but not through social media platforms which would trigger them to spend time there.
There are plenty of other options for people to talk.
Control the technology or be controlled by it, it's your choice.

I was inspired to write this by Sam Hunt's song [Breaking Up Was Easy In The 90's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AETFW8KSIoY).
