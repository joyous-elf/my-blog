# Chatting with strangers online

Have you ever chatted with strangers online?
I bet you have.
I, for one, sure had my fair share of this.
Chatting with strangers is one of my most notable online experiences and I want to talk about it in this post.

## Yahoo! Messenger, hi5 and my fascination with chatting

Unlike kids today, I didn't have an internet connection until I was 13.
I remember I was fascinated with Yahoo! Messenger and with the popular social network in my country at that time, [hi5](https://hi5.com) because it was my first encounter with such applications.
In the beginning, I was chatting on Yahoo! Messenger only with my classmates.
Then, I realized that through hi5, I can chat with anyone there and it felt incredible.
I would give people my Yahoo! Messenger contact details and move the chatting there.
At first, I was chatting only with other Romanian teens but then I discovered I could also chat in English with people all over the world.
I was only 15 when I started chatting in English, I was so happy that I was actually able to carry out a conversation in an other language and I saw it as an opportunity to practice the language but I couldn't really connect with many people because to my disappointment, most of them were looking for sex, not for friendship.
That was the time when I discovered that internet was full of sad, lonely people.
However, I found a guy on hi5 who would be my friend for years and I was happy about it.
I was active on hi5 since I got internet until Facebook came along.

## Going offline and random chat sites

In 2010 Facebook gained popularity in Romania, so people moved from hi5 to Facebook.
But there I wouldn't try to meet strangers any more because I was disappointed with most of the random encounters I had so far and I'm not really sure but I suppose I started to think about the fact it could be dangerous to just add anyone on Facebook.
After one year however, I decided to close all my online accounts, because I got fed up with online interactions, both with people I knew in real life and with online strangers and I was a bit concerned about my privacy too.
And it turned out to be a good decision, because then I had the best years of my high school life and I was feeling for the first time I was making some real connections with my classmates.

But sometimes, when feeling lonely, I'd still go to random chat sites, because no matter how well I was getting along with some of my classmates, I didn't have a deep connection with anyone and at times I was feeling empty inside because of it.
However I wouldn't feel  the kind of closeness I was so much longing for until I met my boyfriend when I was 21, but the long wait was worth it.

As I was saying before, in my last two years of high school I stayed mostly offline and focused on real life connections.

However, things changed when I started university.

## Rejoining the online world and present

Once a university student, I had to rejoin the online world, including Facebook.
While I understood I had to have an email address so my teachers could contact me, I was displeased with the fact that I had to rejoin Facebook, but I had no other choice.
In Romania, it is common for students to have Facebook groups where they get information on what's going on at the university and where they discuss school related problems.
During university, I started to look for language exchange sites to practice my English and that's how I met my boyfriend.

Even to the present day, sometimes I go on certain chatting apps, because I love meeting new people. Currently I'm using the mobile game Avakin and the language exchange app Tandem to chat with people. For me it's just fascinating to get to know people from all around the world. And it's amazing that few of those people remain my friends through the years.
