# About me

Hello, my name is Ioana and I have ICP (Infantile Cerebral Palsy).
I decided to write a blog just to have an occupation and to try my hand at writing in English.
I wanted to start it last year but I wrote one post and I gave it up thinking it wasn't for me and that I'd better find a job instead, which I did soon after.
But now I was looking for something to do and I was advised by my boyfriend to try writing again.
And I wanna do it, at least for a short while, because I have few ideas and because it will somehow make me feel better.
I wanna start writing about myself and my own life experiences and maybe it will help me clear my mind a little bit.
But my goal is that in future I can create a blog with information not only about me, but useful information for other people.
